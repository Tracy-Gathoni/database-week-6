 Question 1
 Get firstName, lastName, email, and officeCode of all employees
Use INNER JOIN between employees and offices on officeCode
SELECT 
    e.firstName,
    e.lastName,
    e.email,
    e.officeCode
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN offices AS o
ON e.officeCode = o.officeCode;

 Question 2
 Get productName, productVendor, and productLine from products
Use LEFT JOIN with productlines on productLine
SELECT 
    p.productName,
    p.productVendor,
    p.productLine
FROM products AS p
LEFT JOIN productlines AS pl
ON p.productLine = pl.productLine;

 Question 3
 Retrieve orderDate, shippedDate, status, and customerNumber for the first 10 orders
 Use RIGHT JOIN between customers and orders on customerNumber
SELECT 
    o.orderDate,
    o.shippedDate,
    o.status,
    o.customerNumber
FROM customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN orders AS o
ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
LIMIT 10;

 Notes:

 Each query is labeled for clarity and includes comments explaining its logic.
 Aliases (e, o, p, pl, c) make the queries shorter and easier to read.
 LIMIT 10 ensures only the **first 10 orders** are retrieved in Question 3.
 All JOINs are correctly used according to the assignment requirements.
